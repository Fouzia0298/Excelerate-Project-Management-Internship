## 📘 Overview

Welcome to the documentation of my **Project Management Virtual Internship** with **Excelerate**, where I collaborated with an amazing team to plan the **Global Virtual Summit on Experiential Learning**.

This was a four-week internship that involved strategic planning, risk management, scheduling, budgeting, and presenting a comprehensive project proposal to leadership.

I served as part of **Team 0505 SLU PM Team 3**, working closely with roles such as Event Planner, Content Lead, Technical Lead, Finance Manager, and more. Our goal was to design a fully remote, inclusive, and impactful three-day summit scheduled for **November 1–3, 2025**, under a **$30,000 budget**.
